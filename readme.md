# Awesome React Components [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/akoenig/awesome-react-components.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/akoenig/awesome-react-components)

A collection of awesome React components.

## Motivation

Well, there are a lot of really awesome (and I don't mean it because of the movement) lists regarding all things React. You can spend a whole hour or ten just browsing those lists (what I do from time to time). The problem I've encountered is that it is hard to remember those components. I'm pretty sure you faced moments, like: "Wow, this is awesome and I have to use it in my next project" â€“ and then when the project comes: "What was the name of this component?". Y'all know that, right? [Remembering](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/featured/writing-and-remembering-why-we-remember-what-we-write.html) stuff when writing it down seems THE proper way to digest it more deeply. So in the vein of that, this is my list! I guess some of the components are also in other lists and others may not. Maybe some of those are also helpful for you. Who knows? Have fun!
